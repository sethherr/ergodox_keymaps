# My keyboard layout for the ErgoDox

Made with the **ErgoDox EZ Configurator** - [view/clone layout on the configurator](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/PMZRZ/latest/0)

Mac user, [here are my shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/sethherr/094eb7e2261cff16afd0)

There are keys that I can't reach, don't use regularly and hence forget what they do - so I removed them.

You can install the firware via the Ergodox configurator, by pressing the "Teensy reset button" ([the tiny hole in the upper right](tiny_reset_button.jpg))
